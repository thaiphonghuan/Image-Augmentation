# Image Augmentation ##
### A powerful technique used in machine learning and computer vision to artificially expand the diversity of training datasets by applying various transformations to the original images, such as rotation, scaling, flipping, and color adjustments, thereby enhancing the model's robustness and performance.

### In this project, we specifically utilize nine primary augmentation techniques: salt and pepper noise, rotation, perspective transformation, Gaussian noise, hue adjustment, grayscale conversion, image flipping, brightness adjustment, and blurring.
